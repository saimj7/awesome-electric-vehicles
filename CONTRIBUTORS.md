# Contributor Guidelines

Hi there! Awesome to see you'd like to contribute.

***So, please follow these guidelines before opening a pull request:***

--- 

- Check for any duplicated resources.
- Make sure the resource is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and a good succinct description in a big picture.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- ***Follow the already applied style/format.*** Note that it might vary for different sections.
- Always check your typos/spelling and grammar.
- The pull requests and commits should have a good title. For example., ***'Added xxx in xxx section'.***
- Before/After your contribution, please make sure all your added links are indeed working.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

**To sum up,** please remember that every contribution no matter how **small**, is highly appreciated and encouraged as it helps gather all the resources in one place :)
