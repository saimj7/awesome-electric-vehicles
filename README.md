### Supercapacitors

In short, supercaps are high-capacity capacitors. They have higher capacitance and lower voltage limits than other types of capacitors, and functionally, they lie somewhere in between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. A recent study (02 June 2020) shows **Lightweight green** supercaps are flexible, cost effective and could even charge EVs witin minutes in the near future!
